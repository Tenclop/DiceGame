## About
  <p>
  As the name sais, itâ€™s a dice game! I made this to practice DOM manipulation and it ended being something fun.
  </p>

## Rules:
Normal winning score it's 100, but you can always change it.

- if u get an 1 its next players turn
- if u get two of 6, you will lose all your score
- if u get two of 3, your current dice score(3+3) its gonna be multiplied by 3;
- don't forget to have fun and "HOLD" your possition;
